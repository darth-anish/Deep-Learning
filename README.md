Face_Recog_Model is a 3 class classification deep neural network.
It has 1 CNN layer, 1 maxpooling layer and two fully-connected layers.
The output layer is a softmax layer.
Face_Predictor.py is a script to predict the probability of classifying a random picked test data in rgb format from a local folder to one of the classes. It outputs results as probability value, test data and predicted class images.
